🔍 Budget and Forecast Model for 2025 – Complete Financial Planning in Excel

I’ve built a robust Budget and Forecasting tool in Microsoft Excel designed to support informed business decisions through accurate financial projections, scenario analysis, and expense tracking.

📌 Key Highlights of the Model:

Developed multiple forecast cases – Best Case, Worst Case, and a Live Scenario – to help business leaders prepare for different market conditions and make flexible strategic decisions.

Real-time monitoring of department-wise actual operating expenses compared with forecasted values. This helps identify overspending and cost-saving opportunities.

A dedicated sheet with interactive visualizations compares budget vs. actuals, highlights variances, and supports performance review meetings.
